Lab 1 - Task 4: User Input and Output
GGY3061 Python Programming for Earth Sciences

Instructions:
1. Collect sample information from the user using input()
2. Display a formatted summary of the collected data
3. Classify the grade: >= 2.0 is "Economic", otherwise "Sub-economic"

TODO: Complete the sample entry system below
"""

# --- Part A: Collect sample information from user ---
# Use the input() function to ask for each value
# Hint: use float() to convert grade and int() to convert depth
# TODO: Ask the user for a sample ID (text)
# TODO: Ask the user for a rock type (text)
# TODO: Ask the user for a grade in % (convert to float)
# TODO: Ask the user for a depth in meters (convert to int)


# --- Part B: Display formatted summary ---
# TODO: Print a header line: --- Sample Summary ---
# TODO: Print each value on its own line
#   Sample ID: <value>
#   Rock Type: <value>
#   Grade: <value to 2 decimal places>%
#   Depth: <value> meters
# Hint: use f-strings, e.g. print(f'Grade: {grade:.2f}%')


# --- Part C: Classify the grade ---
# TODO: If grade >= 2.0, print "Classification: Economic"
#       Otherwise, print "Classification: Sub-economic"
